# Generated JSON fixtures

The JSON files in this directory are exported from the YAML sources in the parent
`docs/data-model/fixtures/` folder. They are provided for reference and for any
external tooling that expects a JSON payload, but the YAML files remain the
canonical, human-edited content. When updating fixtures, edit the YAML files and
re-export the JSON outputs instead of modifying these files directly.
