Alderic exhales slowly as the map-table's braziers dim, letting the glow of the Whisperwood routes reflect in his eyes.
He gestures toward Silverthorn's northern frontier where Durnhelm's wards failed, the parchment still streaked with ash.

"Sporefall was only the first tremor," he murmurs. "Aisling's scouts report moonwell water curdling overnight."
He slides a lacquered token toward you—the Mark of Ciara—bearing the silver knot that binds oath to action.

"Follow the pilgrims' road. Skirt the low mist near the Whisperwood edges and listen for the bracken thrush."
"If it falls silent, turn back; the cultists ride the silence like a banner." Alderic's tone is taut, not pleading.

He shows a charcoal sketch of Bronach's watchtower, the lanterns shuttered. "Bronach will signal twice if the Archive is sealed."
"If you see only one flash, Sporefall's corrosion has touched the wards. You will need moonwell water and salt charms."

Finally, he nods toward a folded vellum marked with three sigils—Aodhan, Ciara, and Edda—arranged around a faded circle.
"Allies wait in the chapel ruins beyond the Whisperwood ferry. Keep to the canonical route; improvisation feeds the fog."
