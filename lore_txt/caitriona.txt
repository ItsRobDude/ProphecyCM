Traits
1.	Spectral Nature. Caitriona is an incorporeal spirit bound to the Cathedral of Bone. She doesn't 
require air, food, drink, or sleep. She hovers gently off the ground and can pass through small 
gaps or around obstacles if needed. If reduced to 0 HP, she discorporates into a swirl of silvery 
light, re-forming at the Cathedral after 24 hours unless the Cathedral's magic is dispelled.
2.	Serene Presence. Hostile creatures within 10 feet of Caitriona feel an odd sense of calm tug at 
their minds. When a hostile creature makes its first attack on a turn while in that area, it must 
make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it can't target Caitriona with that attack and 
must choose a different target (or lose the attack if no valid target exists). A creature that 
succeeds is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
3.	Spellcasting (Cleric). Caitriona is a 6th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell 
save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following cleric spells prepared/known 
(focusing on healing, restoration, and pacification):
o	Cantrips (at will): 
Guidance, Sacred Flame, Spare the Dying, Thaumaturgy
o	1st Level (4 slots): 
Cure Wounds, Sanctuary, Detect Magic, Command
o	2nd Level (3 slots): 
Calm Emotions, Lesser Restoration, Spiritual Weapon
o	3rd Level (2 slots): 
Revivify, Mass Healing Word
4.	Gentle Heart (Healer's Mercy). When Caitriona reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a spell or 
melee attack, she can choose not to kill it; instead, the creature becomes stable and unconscious 
at 0 HP. This underscores her unwillingness to fully destroy life, even in undeath.
 
Actions
1.	Multiattack. Caitriona makes two Sacred Flame attacks (cantrips) or casts one leveled spell and 
uses a cantrip in the same round (adhering to 5e's bonus action/spellcasting rules as 
appropriate).
2.	Spectral Touch (Melee Spell Attack): 
+6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) radiant damage. A creature that takes this damage must succeed on a DC 14 
Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on its next attack roll against Caitriona, as her 
soothing aura briefly confuses aggression.
3.	Tranquil Respite (Recharge 5-6). 
Caitriona channels healing energies in a 20-foot radius. Each creature of her choice in that area 
regains 7 (2d6) hit points. Hostile creatures that regain hit points from this effect must 
immediately make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become Charmed by Caitriona until the end 
of their next turn, overwhelmed by her gentle aura.
 
Behavior & Tactics
*	Nonviolent First Approach: Caitriona rarely initiates combat unless threatened. She might start 
with Sanctuary or Calm Emotions to de-escalate a tense encounter.
*	Healing Allies (or Herself): If forced to fight alongside other Cathedral guardians (e.g., Fiona, 
Aisling), she'll cast Mass Healing Word or Cure Wounds to sustain them, then move to the 
fringes, letting her Serene Presence hamper attackers.
*	Avoiding Lethality: In line with her Gentle Heart trait, she tries not to kill unless absolutely 
necessary. She'll stabilize downed foes if it suits her or the Cathedral's "need for living 
worshipers or watchers."
*	Spell Priority:
o	Round 1: Sanctuary or Calm Emotions if hostilities begin.
o	Round 2: Possibly Spiritual Weapon for defense, or Command to pacify a strong melee 
fighter.
o	Round 3+: Tranquil Respite if her allies are injured or to disrupt the party's aggression. If 
cornered, she might Revivify an ally or Mass Healing Word to keep undead guardians up.
 
Roleplay & Personality Hooks
*	Quiet Acceptance: She has come to terms with Whisperwood's fate, believing nature sometimes 
takes a dark course beyond mortal control. She tries to minimize suffering.
*	Fond of Aodhan: She admired his drive to save Liam and the borough, insisting he wouldn't truly 
unleash evil. She doesn't blame him wholly-she suspects outside manipulation (possibly from 
Alderic).
*	Offers Compassion: If the party isn't overtly hostile, Caitriona can provide healing or advice, 
explaining that the stasis-bound Liam still "lives" in some form-and that there may be a way to 
free him.
 
Treasure / Loot
*	Symbol of the Healing Ward: A small silver amulet shaped like intertwined vines, worth 25 gp 
but can also serve as a holy symbol for a cleric/druid/paladin.
*	Medical Satchel (Spectral): Contains intangible vials or herbs. If the party can "dispel" or 
"coalesce" them, it might yield 1-2 Potion of Healing or Greater Healing potions (GM's choice).
*	Cathedral Records: Possibly stashed in her old healing ward, containing notes on who was 
injured or sick prior to the ritual. Some references might tie into Liam's condition or Aodhan's 
frantic attempts to gather power.
