Eldritch Knight Features
1.	Spellcasting (Fighter). Aisling is a 6th-level Eldritch Knight. Her spellcasting ability is 
Intelligence (spell save DC 11, +3 to hit with spell attacks). She typically prepares a handful of 
utility/offensive spells:
o	Cantrips (at will): 
Prestidigitation, Green-Flame Blade, (or Booming Blade), Blade Ward
o	1st Level (4 slots): 
Shield, Thunderous Smite, Command (via Eldritch Knight's 1st-level picks)
o	2nd Level (2 slots): 
Mirror Image, Misty Step
(Eldritch Knights usually choose from the Abjuration or Evocation schools, but you can flavor some 
unique picks to reflect her vengeful nature.)
2.	Weapon Bond. Aisling's longsword is bound to her. As a bonus action, she can summon it to 
her hand from elsewhere on the same plane.
3.	Second Wind (1/Short Rest). As a bonus action, she can regain 1d10+6 hit points.
4.	Action Surge (1/Short Rest). Once on her turn, she can take an additional action.
5.	Furious Guardian. Aisling exudes an aura of simmering rage. While she has fewer than half her 
HP remaining (? 42 HP), her weapon attacks deal an additional 2 damage (of the weapon's 
type).
 
Actions
1.	Multiattack. Aisling makes two melee weapon attacks, or one melee weapon attack and casts 
a cantrip (e.g., Green-Flame Blade).
2.	Longsword (Melee Weapon Attack): 
+7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage (versatile 1d10 + 4 if wielded with two hands).
o	If she's under Furious Guardian (below half HP), add +2 damage.
3.	Reckless Slash (Recharge 5-6). 
Aisling channels her anger into a powerful overhead strike. She makes a single longsword 
attack against a target within 5 ft. On a hit, the target takes an extra 2d8 necrotic damage 
(flavored as her spirit-laced rage). A creature that takes this extra damage must succeed on a 
DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be Frightened of Aisling until the end of its next turn.
o	Flavor: Black tendrils of ghostly energy swirl around her blade, searing the target's 
mind with Aisling's unresolved rage.
 
Bonus Actions
*	Misty Step (2nd-Level Spell). If needed, Aisling can use her 2nd-level spell slot to teleport 30 ft. 
as a bonus action. This helps her reposition or chase fleeing foes, heightening her battlefield 
threat.
*	Fighter Features like Second Wind may also use a bonus action.
 
Reactions
*	Shield (1st-Level Spell). Aisling can cast Shield to boost her AC by +5 until her next turn 
(potentially up to AC 22), making her extremely hard to hit in a pinch.
 
Behavior & Tactics
*	Pre-Combat:
o	She might cast Mirror Image if she knows a fight is coming, giving her illusions that 
soak up attacks.
o	Summons her bound longsword if it's not already in hand.


*	Opening Moves:
o	Engage in melee, using standard attacks. She might cast Thunderous Smite if she wants 
to knock foes back and intimidate them with a display of force.
o	If a big threat emerges, she might use Action Surge to unleash a Reckless Slash plus an 
extra melee attack or a cantrip in the same round.
*	Sustained Combat:
o	She has decent spells but is primarily a martial fighter. She might hold a Shield reaction 
for tough hits.
o	If forced to chase a ranged attacker, she can Misty Step to close the gap.
*	Furious Guardian:
o	Once she's below half HP, she becomes truly dangerous, dealing extra damage. She's 
also not above using Second Wind to regain HP mid-battle, then going back below half 
HP to keep the extra damage.
*	Retreat or Rage?
o	Aisling rarely retreats. She's consumed by guilt and anger, especially if the party wields 
Aisling's Corrupt Vigil or reminds her of Alderic's betrayal. She'll fight until forced 
unconscious or the party somehow calms her.
 
Personality & Roleplay Hooks
*	Undead Guilt: She believes she failed to protect Whisperwood, carrying the weight of many 
lost lives. In her undead state, that guilt has hardened into anger at anything bearing Ciara's or 
Alderic's mark.
*	Fierce Honor: She might respect skilled fighters. A parley is possible if the party demonstrates 
honorable combat or claims to avenge the borough.
*	Bow Reaction: If someone holds "Aisling's Corrupt Vigil" (the previously corrupted bow) and 
has not cleansed it, she'll react with heartbreak, fury, or demands for explanation.
"I was sworn to guard these halls. You-defilers-wear the stench of Alderic's betrayal... I will have 
your heads for what you've done!"
 
Treasure / Loot
*	Eldritch Longsword (not necessarily a magic item, but could be a rare-level item dealing +1 
damage or returning to her hand if parted). The party might salvage it as a +1 longsword, or it 
might crumble if her spirit is truly laid to rest-it's your call.
*	Personal Effects: Possibly a tarnished signet or a battered helmet with the cathedral's crest.
*	Notes or Clues: If they rummage her war room, they might find personal diaries referencing 
Aodhan's final day, or an incomplete battle plan with hints about the catastrophic ritual.
 
Encounter Difficulty
*	As a CR 5 creature with martial plus limited spells, Aisling can present a hard challenge for five 
4th-level PCs:
o	Multiple Attacks and Extra Damage from Furious Guardian in later rounds.
o	Spells like Shield, Mirror Image, or Misty Step keep her mobile and durable.
o	Reckless Slash (Recharge) can inflict significant spike damage and cause Fear.
Players lacking crowd control or strong defense must handle her carefully-especially once her fury 
triggers, turning her into a punishing melee threat. Diplomacy or strategic thinking might defuse her 
rage without a full-scale brawl, but if they go in swinging blindly, they'll face a furious Eldritch Knight 
with the zeal of a lost guardian.
Use Aisling's haunting anger to underscore the Cathedral of Bone's tragedy-she was once a proud 
captain, now twisted into an undead sentinel by her own guilt and the cathedral's dark power.
